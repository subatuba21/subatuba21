## About Me

I am a passionate web developer determined to create helpful services and technologies. I currently am a student at Amador Valley High School, where I am an officer in two CS clubs. As a student of software development, I'm always looking forward to grow my skills and learn new technologies.

## Hack4Impact Individual Contributor

Hack4Impact is a nonprofit that connects student software developers with nonprofits and other socially responsible businesses to develop powerful new tools for social change.

As an individual contributor within Hack4Impact, I develop internal software and other products including developer guides, automation scripts, websites and more. Here are some of the H4I projects I have worked on:
